Created a class named Board that implements some of the features of the Connect Four game. The Board class will have three data members: there will be a two-dimensional list
(a list of lists) containing characters to represent the game area, and a pair of variables holding the number of rows and columns on the board (6 rows and 7 columns is standard), but your Board datatype
will be able to handle boards of any size. 

Here is an example of how your board should look:
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | |O| |O| | |
| |X|X|X|O| | |
