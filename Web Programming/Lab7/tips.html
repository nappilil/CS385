        <h2>Long Beach Island, New Jersey</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Traveling</h3>
                <p>Make sure to leave early in the morning. It is also better to leave during the week than on a Friday or Saturday to avoid traffic. If you're coming from North Jersey, the parkway to shore points is your best bet to get there. 
                To drive anywhere in NJ you should have an EZ-Pass otherwise you'll have to pay tolls with cash which will slow down your trip.</p>

                <h3>Don't Buy Essentials While You're There</h3>
                <p>Don't buy boogie boards, shovels, or other items when you get there. It is far more expensive than if you were to buy near you or bring what you already have.
                Even if you think you don't want it, you probably will so bring it anyway.</p>
            </li>

                <h3>What to do on Rainy Days?</h3>
                <p>Bring movies, music, your videogame console, board games, etc. This will make the those rainy days still very fun. Its also great for bonding with whoever you traveled with.</p>

        <h2>Hoboken, New Jersey</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
              <h3>Traveling</h3>
              <p>Take public transportation to get here. There is not much parking available and if you are lucky enough to grab a spot it can be quite expensive. Everything is also in walking distance so there is not much need for a car.
              If you take NJ transit, make sure to download the app to buy tickets as you'll be able to buy the off-peak round trip tickets which are cheaper than the normal one-way adult tickets. Just make sure you are traveling in the off-peak time periods which you can see on their website and app.</p>

              <h3>Best Seasons & Weather To Come</h3>
              <p>It's best to come in the Spring and Summer when the weather is enjoyable. Hoboken is notorious for being very windy making the colder seasons sometimes brutually cold. Since Hoboken has so many parks and recreational areas it's best to utilize them when it's warm out! Also try to avoid coming when it is raining as it tends to flood a lot which can make traveling very difficult.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Busy Times</h3>
              <p>Washington St. is always very busy, however, it is especially busy at noon during the week as college and highschool students flood the street for lunch. There will also be several grubhub and postmate bicycle drivers zooming around to deliver food. The Waterfront is also especially busy in the morning and evenings on weekdays from commuters looking to go to Hoboken Terminal. 
              So basically if you don't want to deal with a ton of foot traffic in these areas, make sure to avoid going to them during these times.</p>

      <h2>New York City, New York</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Traveling</h3>
            <p>Unless you're a taxi driver, don't drive here. Traffic is crazy, parking is expensive and New York City natives don't care about traffic laws.
            If you plan on taking NJ transit, you can get off at Secaucus and trafer to Penn Station or ride until Hoboken where you can take the path.
            I reccomend the path and legally I have to say you'll need a metrocard to ride but you'll use it if you need to take the subways too. I tend to avoid the subways but sometimes you have no choice. Once you buy a metrocard for $5 I reccomend putting at least $20 on it for every trip you go on this way you will have more than enough for wherever you end up going. Just make sure to check when it expires on the back of the card as you won't be able to use it after that date.
            The ferry is an experience you must have at least once as you'll be able to view the Hudson River. Just make sure to put your hair up if you have long hair as the wind from the ferry will make it super messy.</p>

            <h3>Best Seasons & Weather to Come</h3>
            <p>During Christmas time it is magical. Even if you don't celebrate, the entire city is decorated so beautifully for this holiday however everything is more expensive. Just make sure to bring a hat and gloves and it will be fantastic. The Summer is also great but with there rarely ever any shade and it can often be so hot its hard to endure walking for so long. Definitely bring water if you plan on coming in the summer and be sure to go to fast food places or parks to be able to refill it. You don't want to end up paying more than $1 for a water bottle.</p>

            <h3>Avoid Tourist Traps</h3>
            <p>Don't buy things off of street vendors. People will try to hand you flyers for special deals. Just make sure to follow stranger danger to avoid getting scammed. Often times its fake designer merchandise or can even be something with drugs. Just remember to be smart and be safe.</p>
