            <h2>Long Beach Island, New Jersey</h2>
            <p>Long Beach Island, or LBI, is a charming summer destination on the Jersey Shore, where you can enjoy the sun, sand, and sea. You can have a quiet retreat in the north, where you can visit the historic Barnegat Lighthouse and the fishing village of Viking. You can also have a a lively adventure in the south, where you can have fun at the amusement park and water park in Beach Haven. LBI has something for everyone of all ages. You can also explore the island's culture, history, and cuisine in the various towns that dot the 18-mile-long island. To get to LBI, just take Exit 63 off the Garden State Parkway and cross the bridge to paradise.</p>
            <p>My experience has always been one that left me feeling happy and refreshed. Maybe I'm biased because I grew up going there, but whenever I get the chance to visit again now it always brings back so much nostalgic and memories of playing arcade games with my cousins, boogie boarding at the beach, riding my bike along the bay and eating lots of icecream.</p>

            <h2>Hoboken, New Jersey</h2>
            <p>Hoboken, New Jersey, nestled along the Hudson River just across from NYC, is a charming city with a vibrant atmosphere and rich history. 
              Known for its picturesque waterfront, lively bar scene, and diverse culinary offerings, Hoboken offers a unique blend of urban energy and small-town charm. 
              You go to soak in the stunning views, experience its rich cultural heritage, or simply enjoy a night out on the town.
              It is home of the famous singer Frank Sinatra where you will see dedications of him all throughout the city with a bouldevard and statue made in his honor.
              The first ever baseball game took place in here in the Elysian Fields.</p>
            <p>My experience has been that I never run out of things to do or places to go to despite the town being one square mile. 
              Some of my favorite all time places to eat are here although it can be quite expensive the food really is worth it.
              Also because it is so small you'll likely run into the same people wherever you go. There's also never a shortage of dogs throughout the city which is great if you're a dog lover but maybe not if you're allergic.</p>

            <h2>New York City, New York</h2>
            <p>New York City or simply NYC, is the most populous city in the United States, located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world's largest natural harbors. What's good in New York City? Everything. From delicious eats and iconic sights to our diverse neighborhoods and easily accessible transportation, there's no better adventure than exploring the five boroughs.</p>
            <p>My experience has always been different every time I've gone there is always something new to explore.
              There's very iconic historical places to see as well as very small niche places that you'll love. I know of a friend who recently went to a gaming cafe in NYC which just shows all of the possibilities there are here.
