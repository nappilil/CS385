            <h2>Pirate Ship Cruise!!</h2>
            <cite>08/23/2014</cite>
            <p>My family and I got to travel on an actual Pirate Ship! We got to watch the sunset and see dolphins swimming in the water. 
              I was wearing my favorite US Womens Team Soccer jersey with two gold stars as they have won two World Cups. Unfortunately a man accidentally spilled some rum on my jersey. I don't really know what that is except that it is what pirates drink.

            <p>My second Ticket Tape Parade for the US Women's Soccer Team after they won their fourth World Cup! This time my mom let me bring my two closest friends with me. We got interviewed by News12 and got to be on TV! Then we continued the celebration with some great treats at The Sugar Factory.</p>

          <h2>New Beginnings</h2>
          <cite>07/01/2021</cite>
          <p>My friends and I took a train ride to this city where I'll be going to school for the next four years. I don't really know my way around but my friend whose Uncle used to live here told me I'll figure it out easily. We took a bunch of disposable pictures and walked along the waterfront because my friends really like to see the view. We got playa bowls and played in one of the parks by the water.</p>

            <cite>03/24/2024</cite>
            <p>My girlfriend's Aunt who is from San Fransico came to visit her. We showed her all the best spots in town including the waterfront where there's a statue of Frank Sinatra. We also took her to the museum where some girls were selling Girl Scout Cookies. We also walked along Washington St and brough her to Robongi since they have a fantastic lunch special for sushi.</p>
