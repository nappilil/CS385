# CS-546 Lab 7
## An HTML Document

For this lab, we will embark on a virtual journey by creating 3 travel-inspired HTML pages. While we may not leave our desks, we'll travel far and wide in our imagination!

Unlike our previous node-based labs, this one will solely focus on HTML.

### Major Concepts

- Making data-centered HTML Documents
- Thinking in terms of describing our data, without care for the visual aspect
- Focusing on structure and semantical validity
- Writing valid HTML

### Linking between pages
You will use a basic navigation structure on each page to link to all the pages you are writing. Each page should include a navigation that links to ALL other pages (including the page you're on).

```html
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Page 1</a></li>
      <li><a>Page 2</a></li>
      <li><a>Page 3</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
