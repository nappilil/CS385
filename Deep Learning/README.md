Deep learning (DL) is a family of the most powerful and popular machine learning (ML) methods and has wide realworld applications such as face recognition, machine translation, self-driving car, recommender system, playing the Go game, etc. Covers fundamental ML, computer vision, and natural language problems and DL tools for solving the problems. Used DL methods for solving real-world ML problems. Homeworks involve the implementation and programming using the Python language and popular DL frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.
