### Author: Lilli Nappi

## Description
This lab involves implementing logistic regression models using various optimization techniques: Batch Gradient Descent (BGD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD). The objective is to train and evaluate these models on a Breast Cancer dataset, comparing their performance and tuning parameters for optimal results.
